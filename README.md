# Uni-OOSD-Project
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a 2nd year Computer Science module at UWE. The application is built in Java and is designed to automate the scheduling of tennis matches for tournaments or leagues. During this module, we had to learn the programming language, Java, and create an Tennis Match Scheduler and Viewer desktop app.
